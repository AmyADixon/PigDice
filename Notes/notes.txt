Objective:
    Create a functional pig dice game for two human players
    (or one player playing against themselves)

Rules:
    Players take turns rolling a single dice; players will 
    accumulate their rolls as long as they don't get a one. 
    If a one is rolled, then they get 0 points and turn is
    ended. Turn can be passed over before a one is hit. First
    player to 100 points wins.
